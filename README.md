Scenario - 
You are working for a company located in Toronto, Canada, that schedules hotel reservations. As a software developer, your job is to modify the Landon Hotel scheduling application to meet new requirements under new management. You will choose any application user you would like.
You have been provided a Spring application with a Java back end, an Angular front end, and web links and a supporting document to assist you in your work.


Modify the Landon Hotel scheduling application for localization and internationalization by doing the following:

1.   Install the Landon Hotel scheduling application in your integrated development environment (IDE). Modify the Java classes of application to display a welcome message by doing the following:

a.  Build resource bundles for both English and French (languages required by Canadian law). Include a welcome message in the language resource bundles.

b.  Display the welcome message in both English and French by applying the resource bundles using a different thread for each language.

2.  Modify the front end to display the price for a reservation in currency rates for U.S. dollars ($), Canadian dollars (C$), and euros (â‚¬) on different lines.

3.  Display the time for an online live presentation held at the Landon Hotel by doing the following:

a.  Write a Java method to convert times between eastern time (ET), mountain time (MT), and coordinated universal time (UTC) zones.

b.  Use the time zone conversion method from part B3a to display a message stating the time in all three times zones in hours and minutes for an online, live presentation held at the Landon Hotel. The times should be displayed as ET, MT, and UTC.
